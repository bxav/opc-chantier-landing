Site meetings are essential for proper work coordination. However, they can quickly become time-consuming if not well organized.

## Prepare Your Meeting in Advance

An effective meeting starts with good preparation. Before each meeting:

- Establish a precise agenda
- Send it to participants 48 hours in advance
- Gather necessary documents (plans, photos, previous minutes)
- Identify critical points to address

## Structure the Meeting

During the meeting, follow a clear structure:

1. **Quick round table** (5 min) - Overall progress update
2. **Previous actions review** (10 min) - Follow-up verification
3. **Technical points** (30 min) - Discussion of day's topics
4. **Planning** (10 min) - Coordination of upcoming interventions
5. **Miscellaneous** (5 min) - Open questions

## Use the Right Tools

Audio recording of your meetings with automatic transcription allows you to:

- Never forget any exchanges
- Produce meeting minutes in minutes
- Easily find information

## Ensure Follow-up

After the meeting:

- Send the minutes within 24 hours
- Clearly assign actions with deadlines
- Schedule automatic reminders

With these practices, your site meetings will become a real productivity lever.
