A picture is worth a thousand words. On a construction site, an annotated photo is worth ten thousand.

## The Problem with Text Descriptions

How many times have you received an email describing a defect with vague terms like "crack in the technical area"? Without a photo, interpretation is subjective and error-prone.

## The Advantages of Annotation

Annotated photos allow you to:

- **Precisely locate** the problem on the image
- **Add measurements** and references
- **Indicate severity** with color codes
- **Date and geotag** automatically

## Best Practices

For effective annotations:

1. Take the photo with enough distance for context
2. Use arrows to point to important elements
3. Add short and precise notes
4. Number if multiple elements to report

## Integration into Your Processes

Annotated photos easily integrate into:

- Visit reports
- Non-conformance reports
- Reception documentation
- Exchanges with the design office

Adopt annotated photos and transform your site communication.
